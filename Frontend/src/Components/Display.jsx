Your feedback is really appreciated as you send voice messages. More than text, voice messages were engaging like you mentioned this tip for our public speaking. Sushant sir supported us whenever we had difficulty in our timings, tasks. Never felt pressurized even though it was for a month where consistent efforts were required, along with our tight schedules. Sir please continue teaching and guiding people as you do always."

The customized learning plan provided by Sir helped me to improve my fluency and overcome my fear of communicating in English. The best part of his teachings were different techniques like; silent laughing, QEQA Exercise, asked me to send 2-minute video on random topic and gave his feedback, time management matrix etc. It has helped me to reduce my anxiety level before my main personal interview (UPSC Panel). Continuous monitoring and tracking my progress record was the best part. I felt like Sir was also preparing with me for the interview. Waiting for good result in the interview. Thanks a lot, Sir!",

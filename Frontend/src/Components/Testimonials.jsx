The customized learning plan provided by Sir helped me to improve my fluency and overcome my fear of communicating in English. The best part of his teachings were different techniques like; silent laughing, QEQA Exercise, asked me to send 2-minute video on random topic and gave his feedback, time management matrix etc. It has helped me to reduce my anxiety level before my main personal interview (UPSC Panel). Continuous monitoring and tracking my progress record was the best part. I felt like Sir was also preparing with me for the interview. Waiting for good result in the interview. Thanks a lot, Sir!",
